## Code Structure Explanation

### index.html
- Contains the main structure of the portfolio
- Uses semantic elements such as:
  - `<header>` for title and theme toggle
  - `<nav>` for internal navigation
  - `<section>` for About, Gallery, To-Do, and Contact
  - `<footer>` for copyright
- Links external CSS and JavaScript files

---

### style.css
- Handles all visual styling
- Includes:
  - Color themes
  - Layout spacing
  - Hover effects
  - Responsive design using media queries
- Supports dark and light mode styles

---

### script.js
- Handles all interactivity and logic
- Uses:
  - DOM manipulation
  - Event listeners
  - Reusable JavaScript functions

---

## JavaScript Features Implemented

### 1. Show / Hide Profile Picture
- Toggles the visibility of the profile image
- Button always remains visible to avoid UI issues

### 2. Image Slider
- Allows users to navigate through images using Next and Previous buttons
- Uses an array and index tracking

### 3. To-Do List
- Users can add tasks
- Clicking a task removes it
- Uses dynamic DOM element creation

### 4. Contact Form Validation
